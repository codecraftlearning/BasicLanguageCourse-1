1). research and list down all the applications of a set

2). explain the internal workin of a set and a dictionary
    In Python, both set and dictionary are implemented using a hash table, which allows fast searching, insertion, 
    and deletion in O(1) average time. When an element is added to a set, Python calculates a hash value of the 
    element and stores it at a position based on that hash. In a dictionary, the hash is calculated only for the
     key, and the key–value pair is stored at the corresponding index. When an element or key is searched, Python 
     again computes its hash and directly accesses the memory location, making lookup very fast. If two items get 
     the same hash value, Python resolves it using open addressing by finding another empty slot. Also, set 
     elements and dictionary keys must be immutable so their hash value does not change after being stored.

3). cout the frequency  of every character in a provided string (use dictionary)
    eg:  input -> "my name is khan",  output ->  m=2, y=1, n=2, a=2, e=1, i=1, s=1, k=1, h=1

4). find out if the s1 as string is a substring of s2 or not
    eg: input1 -> "abcdefghij"  input2 -> "efgh" output -> true
    dont use (input2 in input1) as provided in python
